      <h1>Michael's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Michael Valverde, a rising sophomore at the California Institute of Technology.  
          I hope to one day be a professional graphics programmer in the VR space.
          On this page you can read a little bit about myself, as well as some interesting projects I've worked on in the past.
      </p>

      <h3>Background - About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey on December 6th, 2000.  For as long as I can remember, 
          I have always loved games of all sorts- board games, puzzle games, word games, and yes- video games.
          This love of games, especially video games, is what ultimately drove me to want to become a computer scientist- I want to enable others to experience
          the same magic I did when I first discovered video games.  This is why I am especially interested in Virtual Reality (VR), which I view as the frontier
          of game development, with limitless possibilities for immersion and wonder just waiting to be invented.</p>

        <p> I also have an amazing dog named Biscuit who joined my family in 2008.  He is definitely part yorkie-terrier, but his (relatively) large size leads us
             to believe that he is a mix with another dog breed, although we are unsure as to what this mystery breed might be.  Although he likes to act tough, he
             is quite the coward and will run at the first sign of trouble.
        </p>
